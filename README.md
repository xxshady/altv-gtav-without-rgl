exe which replaces GTAVLauncher.exe (skips the rgl/steam/egs launchers) and launches PlayGTAV.exe directly (useful for multiple alt:V client instances)

## How to use
* replace GTAVLauncher.exe in the game folder with your built exe file (or the prebuilt GTAVLauncher.exe from the repo root if you trust this shady guy from the internet)

## How to build
* select Release x64 in visual studio 2022
* build the exe
